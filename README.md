# Pentesting Framework by Open-Sec

This framework was developed by the Open-Sec team as a way to standardize pentesting processes and to have a means of communication and integration between pentesters and their work.

Initially, only the graphic shown below was applied and independent documents (in markdown format) have been developed that are shared among the pentesters of the team.

Additionally, this framework has been used in the training provided by Open-Sec to, implicitly, guide the pentesting processes appropriately among the participants. This repository is a first effort to share this documentation, but in an organized way.

This framework has taken the following standards as reference (whether official by regulations or de facto in the security field):

- OSSTMM Methodology
- OWASP Web Security Testing Guide
- OWASP Mobile Application Security Testing Guide
- OWASP ASVS
- OWASP MASVS
- PCI DSS (Requirement 11.3 [3.2.1] / 11.4 [4.0])
- SWIFT (Control 7.3)

*It is not intended to be a complete guide or a book or a methodology or a framework that includes everything that exists and what is yet to come, it is only a set of information to which to turn for a sequential order of steps and some ideas that are modified over time (either due to obsolescence or improvements).*
